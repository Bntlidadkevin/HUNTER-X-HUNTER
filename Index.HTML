      professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. 
      Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.

   <h1 id="Killua-2">ZOLYDC</h1>
   <p id="content-2">Killua is a twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family.
    The middle child to a family of renowned assassins, the Zoldyck family. Showing great promise from birth, Killua has already mastered many killing techniques at a tender age, and is set to be one of the best assassins the family has ever produced. 
    Bored and tired of killing, Killua unexpectedly rebelled against his family. He met Gon during the first portion of the Hunter Exam and became great friends. 
    He wants to be neither an assassin nor a Hunter but instead follow Gon's friend in his journey. The duo travel to find Gon's missing father Ging and develop supernatural abilities by controlling their Nen energy with Killua developing powers that allow him to control electricity.
